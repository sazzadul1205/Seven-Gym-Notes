### 3.7.3 View Details Component

- **Description**:  
  A **modal component** that displays detailed information about a selected forum thread. It shows the threadâ€™s title, description, metadata (author, category, and creation time), likes, and comments. It also enables logged-in users to like the thread and add comments.

- **Objective**:

  - Provide a **comprehensive view** of a forum thread with all relevant details.
  - Allow authenticated users to **engage** with the thread by liking and commenting.
  - Facilitate **real-time updates** by re-fetching data after user interactions.

- **Functionality**:

  - **Thread Details Display**:

    - Shows thread title, description, and metadata including author (with a link), category, and relative creation time (using a **time ago** utility).

  - **Like Button**:

    - Implements a like feature that updates the like count via an asynchronous patch request.
    - Displays different icons based on whether the user has already liked the thread.
    - Prevents multiple rapid clicks by managing a loading state.

  - **Comment Section**:

    - Provides an input box for logged-in users to add new comments.
    - Disables the comment box if the user has already commented.
    - Displays existing comments with author names and relative times.

  - **Modal Control**:

    - Includes a close button to exit the modal view.
    - Uses a dedicated modal dialog element and integrates with the **ViewDetailsThreadsModal** component.

  - **State Management & Side Effects**:
    - Manages various states such as loading indicators, like loading, new comment input, and modal visibility.
    - Uses `useEffect` to update the selected thread if the underlying forum data changes.

- **Suggestion**:
  - Enhance error handling by providing more detailed feedback on failed like or comment operations.
  - Implement a **debounce mechanism** to prevent rapid-fire like requests.
  - Consider adding a toggle to **show all comments** versus a truncated list for improved usability.
  - Optimize the UI by integrating animations or transitions when the modal opens and closes.
